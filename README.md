# 🧠 AI-MedDiagnostics

AI-MedDiagnostics is a web-based healthcare application designed to help users monitor symptoms and assess potential health risks using machine learning. The platform analyzes user-reported symptoms to estimate the likelihood of various diseases and provides personalized health insights to support early awareness and informed decision-making.

🩺 Key Features

* Symptom-Based Disease Prediction: Uses machine learning models to analyze symptoms and estimate disease likelihood

* Supported Conditions: Includes Dengue, Heart Attack, Paralysis, Hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease, Heart Disease, COVID-19, and more

* Personal Health Assistance: Provides tailored health guidance based on symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle inputs

* User-Friendly Interface: Simple symptom input and easy-to-understand results

* Preventive Focus: Helps users recognize potential risks early and seek appropriate medical consultation

## Personal Health Care Assistance

The Personal Health Care Assistance feature allows users to get personalized health care advice based on their symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle. The system uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze user data and provide personalized advice on diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to improve their overall health.

## COVID-19 Detection

The COVID-19 Detection feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having COVID-19. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having COVID-19.

## Additional Features

- Chronic Kidney Disease Detection
The Chronic Kidney Disease Detection feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having the disease. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, and more. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having Chronic Kidney Disease.

- Heart Disease Detection
The Heart Disease Detection feature also uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having the disease. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and more. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having Heart Disease.
